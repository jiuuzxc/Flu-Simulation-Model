                    <p><strong>Influenza</strong>, commonly known as the <span>flu</span>, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. 
                        These viruses infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs, leading to mild to severe illness. 
                        Influenza typically spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, 
                        and it can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.

                    <p>There are three types of influenza virus:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3><b>Influenza A</b></h3>
                            <br> 
                            This is a known flu type that can cause flu pandemics. This can affect both humans and animals. 
                            Influenza A is split into subtypes according to two proteins on the virus <span>hemagglutinin (H)</span>
                             and <span>neuraminidase (N)</span>.  Hemagglutinin has 18 subtypes while neuraminidase has 11.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3><b>Influenza B</b></h3>
                            <br> 
                            This is a type of flu that is also known to cause flu pandemics. 
                            This primarily affects humans. Instead of subtypes, influenza B has two lineages 
                            that are called B/Victoria and B/Yamagata.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3><b>Influenza C</b></h3>
                            <br> 
                            Typically found on humans,  this is milder than A and B. 
                            This type also doesn’t cause pandemics.
                        </li>

                        Influenza can spread in a variety of environments, especially 
                        those that facilitate close contact between people and where 
                        the virus can survive on surfaces. This can range from crowded 
                        places, poorly ventilated areas, cold and dry climates, and 
                        hospitals and clinics.

                        Flu season typically peaks during the colder months, from <strong>fall to early spring</strong>. 
                        In the Northern Hemisphere, this means it usually runs from <strong>October to March</strong>, 
                        with peak activity often between <strong>December and February</strong>. In the Southern Hemisphere, 
                        flu season occurs from <strong>April to September</strong>.The timing can vary slightly each year, 
                        but flu is more common during these months due to a combination of factors, such as:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Indoor Crowding: People spend more time indoors in closer proximity.</li>
                        <li>Low Humidity: The flu virus thrives in colder, drier air.</li>
                        <li>Weaker Immune Response: Reduced sunlight can lower Vitamin D levels, affecting immunity.</li>

                        While most people recover within a week without medical care, 
                        the flu can cause severe complications like pneumonia or sepsis, 
                        especially in high-risk groups.

                        In industrialized countries, flu-related deaths mainly occur in those aged 65 and older, 
                        while in developing countries, most flu-related deaths in children under five occur.
